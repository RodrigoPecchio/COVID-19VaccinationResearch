Research focused on answering the following questions:

How is the daily vaccination rate per state in the United States correlated to daily COVID-19 cases and deaths?

Is it too early to see the effects of vaccinations on positive COVID-19 cases and related deaths?

# Conclusions

The increase of daily vaccinations at a global scale has been significant, with the highest number of total new vaccinations being 26,427,035 on May 7th, 2021.
• However, we still have a long way to go, given that the positive correlation between daily vaccinations and cases, and deaths can be attributed to countries not yet reaching a level of herd immunity (e.g. the U.S. needs 70% of the population to be vaccinated, and as of May 17th, 2021 we are at 48.72%).
• This correlation can also be attributed to the fact that only a mere 9.04% of the world is vaccinated as of May 17th, 2021.
